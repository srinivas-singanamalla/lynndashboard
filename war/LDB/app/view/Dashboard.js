        html: "NEW DELHI: The war of nerves between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress over railway minister Dinesh Trivedi\'s resignation surfaced yet again on Saturday with Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announcing Mukul Roy as the party\'s choice for the railway ministry. Mamata, however, did not want to spare any word for Trivedi.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"Taking the cue, Trinamool chief whip Kalyan Bandyopadhyay on Saturday rang Trivedi and gave some \"friendly advice\" to put in his papers before he was \"dismissed\" from the post.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"\"I have worked with him (Trivedi). I urged him as a friend to resign gracefully before he is dismissed. Trivedi told me that he will do so only after he gets a written instruction from the Trinamool chairperson. I would only say that Trivedi didn\'t get a written instruction from the Trinamool chief before assuming charge as railway minister. Is there any confusion that the party has lost confidence on him? What\'s the point in doing damage to the party?\" said Bandyopadhyay.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"When asked about Trivedi\'s proposed ouster, Mamata Banerjee said: \"Don\'t ask me anything. You better talk to Trinamool Parliamentary Party chief whip Kalyan Bandyopadhyay. The government is to decide.\"\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"The Trinamool chief\'s naming Mukul Roy is construed as an effort to mount pressure on the Congress and the Prime Minister to sack Trivedi, a day after Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said that the Prime Minister did not enjoy the final authority in a coalition government, as he did in a one-party government. The Prime Minister has to honour the wishes of the coalition partners, Mukherjee said on Friday.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"However, railway minister Dinesh Trivedi isn\'t yielding. \"I am a responsible minister. I have a constitutional responsibility. If the party wants me to quit, the party chairperson should write to me. I am saying this to avoid confusion,\" said Trivedi.\n" + 
				"\n" + 
				"The confusion that Trivedi was hinting at, is the statement made by Trinamool parliamentary leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay in Parliament, a day after the railway budget on March 15. Bandyopadhyay put it on record that the party didn\'t ask Dinesh Trivedi to resign as railway minister."
